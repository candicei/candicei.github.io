## Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, usu ea purto -- just kidding. This is a very real, first post.

Dear all, 

Welcome to my website! I'll be posting my projects here which may get increasingly chaotic. Though, so far everything seems to be set up in order! 


A note to my readers: I once ate a tablespoon of salt to see what would happen. It foamed up and tasted really bad. A grain of salt will do to remind you not to poison yourself with any work that I do. I'll leave it up to you to take the salt exercise from here on out. 


Cheerio,

Candice
