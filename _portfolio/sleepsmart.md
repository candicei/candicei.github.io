description: I helped develop a sensory mattress topper for a robotics research laboratory. This involved designing a prototype and programming a PIC18F4550 to collect data from an array of digital accelerometers and temperature sensors. SPI and UART communication was implemented and data decoded from the sensors were analysed in MATLAB and visualized in LabVIEW.
