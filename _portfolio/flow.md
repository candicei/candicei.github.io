description: We prototyped a Time-of-Flight (TOF) Flow Meter to calculate gaseous fluid velocity within a cylindrical pipe. To solve the challenge, we collected the speed at which a heat pulse travelled down the length of the tube. The electronics (including thermistors, amplifiers, nichrome wire, Arduino) required careful consideration to reduce hardware and software noise to detect the microvolt signals. The data was also analysed in MATLAB.
