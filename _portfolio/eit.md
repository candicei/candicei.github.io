description: I am currently building a cloud chamber using peltier tiles. Current status- testing peltier tiles. With initial tests, a large peltier array (3x3) may not be possible due to large amounts of heat needed to be transferred from the cool surface. In the 3x3 case, the use of additional cooling systems such as a two-stage compressor may be needed.
