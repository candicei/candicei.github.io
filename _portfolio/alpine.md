description: We prototyped a self-sustaining device to be used in alpine environments that can cheaply detect humidity and temperature data over time. The use of having the network of sensors would provide information on the risk of an avalanche in the area. I programmed a Cortex M0 on a Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822 and implemented I2C communication.
