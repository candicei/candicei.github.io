title: Alpine Network Sensor

description: We prototyped a self-sustaining device to be used in alpine environments that can cheaply detect humidity and temperature data over time. The use of having the network of sensors would provide information on the risk of an avalanche in the area. The device uses a Cortex M0 on a Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822 and uses I2C communication to communicate with the Si7006 digital humidity and temperature sensor.
